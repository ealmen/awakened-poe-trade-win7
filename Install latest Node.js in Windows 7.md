Update:  
The guide below doesn't work that well anymore with newer node.js versions.  
Using an older version of node.js still works somewhat as of writing this, but this will become more and more of an issue going forward.  
I would not attempt this anymore myself if I still needed it.  
Use another Windows 10 machine, or use a VM of Windows 10 to compile this from will save you a lot of extra work.

# Node.js doesn't officially support Windows 7 anymore
But unofficially it still works quite well still, after a bit of tinkering.

## How to force latest node.js in Windows 7

Install some old version of node.js to start with. latest v12 or whatever

I used x64.msi from https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.22.12/

---
Download latest zip file of node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download

I used LTS 18.17.1, Windows Binary (.zip) 64-bit

---
Go to C:\Program Files\nodejs  (from v12 we installed previously)

Either delete everything in here, or move nodejs folder and create a new one

extract content of v18 node.js zip here

----
### Create a new environment variable:
right click on Computer -> properties.
Advanced system settings. Advanced tab -> Environment Variables... -> click on New in the bottom half of the window

```
NODE_SKIP_PLATFORM_CHECK
1
```

----
start cmd as admin, and run
```
cd C:\Program Files\nodejs
npm install npm@latest -g
npm install corepack -g			// Not sure what I did here, but npm, yarn and corepack is installed globally for me
npm install yarn -g
```

close cmd, and from this point on, don't install anything else globally (-g), and don't run anything else as admin

It can be a pain to mix globally installed newer versions of modules, and trying to force older versions locally for a specific project. Only use local modules, except for npm and yarn.

(yarn isn't strictly needed. but slightly nicer than npm install I guess)

-----
## Test that it's working
open a new cmd as normal user, type in
```
npm --version      // 10.1.0 or newer
yarn --version     // 1.22.19 or newer
```

If you get error message, or older versions, you need to troubleshoot this more.
